This is a CELL BE port of Kevin Beason's smallpt code.
This fully work on the SPEs processing 4 rays at a time.

To make the code:
spu-gcc -lm -Wall -O3 forwardFloat-spu.c -o forwardFloatSPU
gcc -lspe2 -pthread -Wall -m64 smallpt-ppu.c -o smallptPPU

then use smallptPPU [number of samples] [number of spus]

ex: smallptPPU 48 6

This will produce a file image.ppm with 48 samples in 6 SPEs.
